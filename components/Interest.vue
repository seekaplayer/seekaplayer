      Hello, my name is Seekaplayer, I'm a Web Designer/Developer and Content
      creator. I love learning how to code and I enjoy creating content. I have
      many more interested then just technology. I also really enjoy playing
      video games as well and when I'm not doing either of those things I enjoy
      spending time at the gym.

          I've been streaming since around 2011/2012. I started out streaming on
          YouTube Gaming and then transitioned to Twitch/Kick. Over the past few
          years I've focused on streaming Gaming, Coding/Development and every
          so often I'll do a Music or Fitness stream. I really love interacting
          with my viewers and I've learned a lot from them.

          Health & Fitness are very important to me. Back in 2018 I was at my
          most unhealthiest weighing at around 244.9 pounds at 5'2 1/2 which was
          very unhealthy! I suffered from a lot of health problems because of
          this and decided one day to make a life change. I went on a fitness
          journey and lost a little over 131.1 pounds! This has forever changed
          my life and when I'm not working or making content I work as a Group
          Fitness Instructor to help others with their fitness goals.

          I've been gaming since I was a kid. I started off on the Nintendo NES,
          Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, Playstation 1/2 and then
          from there I got into PC Gaming. When I turned 18 I got my first big
          Gaming PC which was a Gateway which had a Pentium 4 processor, 1 GB of
          Ram, Windows XP and I installed an ATX 256 MB GPU in it. Over the
          years I've had a keen interest in both Gaming PC's and Consoles. I've
          owned mostly XBOX and I've had a few Playstation consoles as well. As
          of now I primarily game on a PC.

          Music has always been a big part of my life. I've been playing guitar
          since I was a kid and I've dabbled in other instruments as well. My
          first instrument was the guitar but I've also have played some on the
          piano, drums, bass, saxophone, trumpet, and others. I love all types
          of music from classical to heavy metal. I enjoy listening to music and
          jamming along with songs I really love.
